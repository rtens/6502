; Rob had the idea of writing a simple ray tracer to render a sphere in front of a blue background
; He implemented the tracer in C and the we started with the Assembly code
; We didn't get further than filling the screen with blue.... so... there you go

; We put the code for light blue into A and zero into Y (needs to be zero so we can use it
;    safely for indirect addressing)
 lda #$e

mainLoop:
; First we put the start address $0200 in $00 and $01 (LSB first: |00|02| => $0200 )
 ldx #$00
 stx $00
 ldx #$02
 stx $01
 ldx #0

 tax
 inx
 txa
 stx $01ff

; Now we loop over the entire screen
loop:
; Put #$e (in A) into the current frame buffer address (starting with $0200)
 sta ($00),y
; Increase the LSB of the frame buffer address
 iny
; Check if we have an overflow
 bne loop
; If we do, increase the MSB
 inc $01
; Make sure that we don't run into the $0600 address space where the code is
 ldx $01
